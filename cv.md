### Reason to attending RS school trainings
I trully want to learn javascript :innocent:. 
I love opportunities and freedom IT offers people. 
JavaScript seems to me like a best choice to start career in IT. It's truly realize principle - easy to start hard to master.
Moreover, JS is now a market leading
programming language with presence on both front-end and back-end sides.
I had several attempts to do learn JS but for some reasons stopped at the begining. 
 Hope this try would be the last and successfull)
 
###  IT hard skills
1.  JavaScript - very novice
2. HTML - novice
3. CSS - novice
4. Git - novice

code examples can be found here - https://github.com/sergeiZh/CodeWars

Unfortunately, has no any JS related experience. Hope that would change after the RS scholl course.
Currently Most of the knowledge I got from youtube videos and free tutorials.  
For now my favorite code example is kata from Code Wars (https://www.codewars.com/kata/find-the-odd-int/).
My solution was
```
function findOdd(numberArr) {
    const valueHolder = new Map();
    numberArr.forEach(element => {
        if(valueHolder.has(element)){
            valueHolder.set(element, valueHolder.get(element)+1);
        } else {
            valueHolder.set(element, 1);
        }
    });
    for(let [key, value] of valueHolder){
        if(value %2 !== 0){
            return key;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```
and the most rated was only 1 line long. I wish I would ever can code the same
```
const findOdd = (xs) => xs.reduce((a, b) => a ^ b);
```
